# Replicated-Key-Value-Storage
Simplified version of Amazon Dynamo for key value storage

Replicated key value storage provides 3 main functionalities:- 
1) Partitioning
2) Replication
3) Failure Handling

1) Partitioning:- Partitioning provides load balancing among the various nodes present in the system. SHA-1 cryptographic
hash function is used to partition the key value pairs using lexicographical order. This is similar to CHORD with the 
little difference, that each and every node in the system knows every other node. Due to this property of the 
system, key value pair can be sent to the appropriate node directly, which further ensures the "Membership" as the main
sending node will be waiting for the acknowledgment from the coordinator.

2) Replication:- Chain replication is used to ensure persistant storage of key value pairs among the appropriate nodes. Key value
pair is sent to the main coordinator for that pair and that coordinator makes sure that it is replicated to its 2 successive
nodes. This method of replication provides "Linearizability" as the write operation is always routed to the head of the chain and the 
read operation is always routed to the tail of the chain.

3) Failure Handling:- In case of failure of any node in the system, the request for the key value pair is sent to its corresponding
successor, which provides with the result. When the node recovers from the failure, all the missed key value pairs for that 
node are copied from the corresponding successor and predecessor. Socket read timeout is used to detect the failure of node 
in the system.
